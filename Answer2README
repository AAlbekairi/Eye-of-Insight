# Eye of Insight

## Description

**Eye of Insight** is a custom search engine index for text "scrolls" (files).  
It supports:
1. **Insert** new scrolls: building an index of tokens with file and line postings.  
2. **Search** for a token: prints the number of occurrences and each `(filename, lineNumber)`.  
3. **Remove** a token: deletes it entirely from the index.  
4. **Traverse** the index: prints all tokens in sorted order.

The index is implemented as a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** of tokens. Each node contains:
- A **token** (`String`)
- A **frequency** counter
- A custom **singly-linked postings list** (`SList`) of `(filename, lineNumber)` pairs

All operations are ASCII-only, include strict boundary and format checks, and require **Java 7**.
